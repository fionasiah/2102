## Sueno Self-Driving Car Interface


## Introduction
Currently, many people are skeptical about self-driving cars and its technology as there are many articles about self-driving carâ€™s test failures. Moreover, in times of emergencies, individuals are still required to have a driving license in case of emergencies as they are required to be able to control the car. 

Some people do not wish to learn driving due to their fears / anxiety /against it, are open towards the idea of a self-driving car that has emergency measures built in and do not require them to learn driving. With that, we created this application to aid this problem.
